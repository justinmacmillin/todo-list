# TodoList Interview.

The expectation of the candidate is to create a TodoList app that has an input and a button. On clicking the button, add a Todo with a checkbox and a label.

This project is made using the command `npx create-react-app`.

# Interview Parts:

Part 1: Shows an input and a button to add to a todo list.

Part 2: Add a button that clears completed todos.

Part 3: Add a button that gets existing todos from a theoretical server.

Part 4: Add a button posts existing todos to theoretical server.

## Using the React App to see each part of the interview.

### Prerequisites
You should have `npm` installed:

1. Make sure you have HomeBrew by running `brew -v`. If you don't have it, run this `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

2. Make sure you have node by running `node -v`. If you don't have it, run: `brew install node`

3. Make sure you have npm by running `npm -v`.

### Step 1: Start the server locally.

1. Pull this repo to your local somewhere: `git clone git@git.soma.salesforce.com:jmacmillin/todo-list.git`
2. Set things up: `npm install`
3. Start your react server: `npm start`
4. If your browser doesn't automatically do it for you, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Step 2: I want to look at each part of the interview.

1. Open the github repo: `cd todo-list`
2. Open App.js
3. Comment/uncomment each of the three components within the `App` function's return statement.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
