# Interview Setup - Day Of.

The React app is meant for you to easily see the progression of the interview (in each component in the `src` directory). On the day of the interview, you have two options:

1. Use [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/).
Put this in the `html` section:
```
<input id="input" placeholder="Todo name here."></input>
<button id="button">
    Add todo.
</button>
<div id="list"></div>
```
And that should be it! Each time you click `Run` at the top left of the screen, jsfiddle should re-run your code.

2. If the candidate is comfortable with React and would prefer to pull down an empty repo, they can clone this [repo](https://github.com/justinmacmillin/todo-list).
